# sn17-ch-job-sd

ComputeHorde + SN17 PoC job for running Stable Diffusion generation

# Usage

Use the `build-image.sh` script to turn a model-config yaml file into a tagged docker image.

You can then use the image locally or upload it to an online registry for use as a ComputeHorde job.

# TODO

- [ ] Preload the model into the image in a way that doesn't also load it into the memory at image
  build time
- [ ] Support for other models via different model-config
- [ ] Shrink the image if possible - without a model, it's >18GB just for the environment
