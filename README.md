# sn17-ch-job-sd

ComputeHorde + SN17 PoC job for running Stable Diffusion generation

## Building job image

In order to schedule jobs on ComputeHorde, a docker image containing the code and model to execute
must be first build and uploaded to a registry. The registry must be accessible by miners.

The `ch-job-image` directory contains a simple Dockerfile and a script (`build-image.sh`) to turn a
"model config" into a ComputeHorde job image:

```shell
cd ch-job-image
./build-job-image.sh ./model-configs/sd15.yml some.docker.registry/sn17-job-sd15:latest
docker push some.docker.registry/sn17-job-sd15:latest
```

## Executing a job

The `ch-job-client` directory contains a sample python project for submitting and validating jobs
on ComputeHorde:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.13
- Bittensor wallet+hotkey for authentication - can be generated just for this purpose
- ComputeHorde Facilitator API key
- SS58 Address of a validator who whitelisted the above wallet
- AWS bucket and credentials with read+write access to the bucket 

### Setup
_(within the ch-job-client directory)_

Initialize a venv and install requirements:
```shell
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Configure the client:
```shell
cp .env.example .env
```
Open the `.env` file with a text editor and fill in the configuration

### Running
Run `python submit_jobs.py`.

This will:
- Scan each subdirectory in the `batches`, each containing a list of prompts 
- Submit it as a ComputeHorde job using the configured image
- Pull in job results - generated images
- In the meantime, submit a "trusted" job with prompt samples to validate the results
- Cross-validate job results with the trusted job
- Report issues
